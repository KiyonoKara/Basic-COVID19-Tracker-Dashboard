# Basic COVID-19 Tracker Dashboard

Somewhat of an extension of [Basic-COVID19-Tracker](https://github.com/KaNguy/Basic-COVID19-Tracker), this is a short and concise dashboard of the three main global COVID-19 statistics which are `cases`, `deaths`, and `recoveries`.

## Main Features
- See global cases, deaths, and recoveries on the only page. 
- Responsive enough.
- Blatantly shows the three COVID-19 stats everyone is looking for.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome mainly for bugs fixes. New feature proposals will take longer to review since the project is just a dashboard.

## Miscellaneous 
The project was tested and ran on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Notice
All COVID-19 projects will be discontinued as of January 1st, 2021. This is because 2020 has been a long and difficult year. That being said, I also want to leave the COVID-19 things behind and start a new year looking forward to the rest of the decade of 2020 - 2030. A vaccine is already out, so we are taking another step forward.
