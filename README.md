# Basic COVID-19 Tracker Dashboard

Somewhat of an extension of [Basic-COVID19-Tracker](https://github.com/KiyonoKara/Basic-COVID19-Tracker), this is a short and concise dashboard that displays the COVID-19 `cases`, `deaths`, and `recoveries`.

## Main Features
- See global cases, deaths, and recoveries on only one page.
- Simple design
